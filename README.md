An experimental AI-powered web app that I made to detect cat breeds from photos. Built with modern web tools and machine learning, this project explores client-side image classification using a custom-trained model.

Features
Upload a cat photo to identify its breed
Real-time cat face detection using COCO-SSD
Custom image recognition model I trained on Google Colab GPUs
Fully browser-based, no server required

Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Svelte) - UI & interaction
TensorFlow.js - Model loading & inference
COCO-SSD - Cat face detection
Google Colab - Model training with GPU acceleration

How It Works
Upload or take a photo of a cat
The app detects the cat's face using COCO-SSD
A custom-trained TensorFlow model classifies the breed
Results are shown instantly in the browser

Disclaimer
This is an experimental project. Accuracy may vary depending on photo quality and breed coverage in the training data.
