I made this experimental AI-powered web app to detect cat breeds from photos. Using modern web tools and machine learning, I built it to explore client-side image classification with a custom-trained model.

Features:
Upload a cat photo to identify its breed
Real-time cat face detection using COCO-SSD
Custom image recognition model I trained on Google Colab GPUs
Fully browser-based, no server required

Built With:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Svelte) - UI & interaction
TensorFlow.js - Model loading & inference
COCO-SSD - Cat face detection
Google Colab - Model training with GPU acceleration

How It Works:
Upload or take a photo of a cat
The app detects the cat's face using COCO-SSD
A custom-trained TensorFlow model classifies the breed
Results are shown instantly in the browser

Disclaimer:
This is an experimental project. Accuracy may vary depending on photo quality and breed coverage in the training data.
